Original Data

The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies human readable activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Labels the data set with descriptive names. (Names are converted to lower case; underscores and brackets are removed.)

Merges the features with activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as tidyData.txt.

The average of each measurement for each activity and each subject is merged to a second data set. The result is saved as tidyData2.txt.


Datasets and Variables:

dat.test: dataset of test/X_test.txt
dat.train: dataset of train/X_train.txt
dat: Combined dataset of dat.test and dat.train datasets
sub.test: dataset of test/subject_test.txt
sub.train: dataset of test/subject_train.txt
sub: Combined dataset of sub.test and sub.train datasets
label.test: dataset of test/y_test.txt
label.train - dataset of train/y_train.txt
label: Combined data set of label.test and label.train dataset
dat.extrated: Extracted dataset only contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
colname: features.txt, contains columns' name
label.activity: activity_labels.txt, contains name of activity
data.tidy: tidy and combined dataset with readable columns' and rows' name.
data.tidy.2nd: dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is a 10299x68 data frame.

The first column is activity
The last column is subject
The columns in between the first column and the last column are average of measurements
